King Law[][0]The Next Generation Of Law Firms

Here at King Law, we focus on so much more than the time it takes to complete the work. We have streamlined and simplified many of the processes that increase the overhead of the firm that causes higher prices. We have also removed many of the artificial barriers between you and your lawyer. You may ask how have we been able to do this? It is simple we embrace technology. We do not even have a fax machine. 

We are a paperless firm, or as paperless as possible. Our files are stored in the cloud backed up to another cloud and for true redundancy stored on an off-site server. All encrypted to protect your confidential information. If our office burns down, your files are still safe. If we suffer a system failure, we have a backup and a backup to the backup.  

We use cloud based software with client portals. Instead of you having to fax a document to us because it is "secure" you can upload it directly into your file through 256-bit encryption which is secure. The time we save by not have to get the fax (and not pay for an additional phone line) and file it seem minimum, but it adds up, and those savings are passed on to you the client. You pay for our knowledge, not out administration work.  

Your time is valuable, and it is not easy to make time to come to our office to meet. That is why we use skype and google hangout, so we can meet face to face whether you are across town or the country. 

If you can or want to come to our office to meet then instead, of playing phone tag and comparing calendars to schedule a meeting you can [schedule an appointment][0] on our website. You will see what days and times are available to meet and then book the time you are available. You can do this whether it is three in the morning or one in the afternoon.
